In the recent years, as indicated in previous chapters, the reliance on mobile devices has significantly increased within enterprises. However, usage of mobile devices is not limited for enterprise networks and it plays a huge role as an inevitable contributor to our daily lives. Therefore, it is of utmost importance not only for enterprises but also individuals to be able to ensure the security of their mobile devices. As a result, a wide range of network monitoring and inspection applications have been developed to enable researchers to capture, inspect, and also analyse network traffic generated by mobile applications. 

Network monitoring and inspection solutions are essential to detect suspicious communication patterns, privacy leakages, among other network and application-related anomalies that may compromise user data and the enterprise's system integrity.

Among a large number of prominent solutions developed in this area, \emph{\textbf{PCAPdroid, Mobeye}}, and \emph{\textbf{AntMonitor}} have illustrated notable progress towards enhancing transparency along with control over mobile network traffic. PCAPdroid provides a non-root approach towards packet capture and employs android's VpnService API to intercept and record traffic in PCAP/PCAPNG format allowing comprehensive network inspection without the need for elevated privileges. On the other hand, Mobeye aims its focus towards large-scale network measurements and data aggregation for further research and monitoring purposes. It contributes valuably in mobile network performance and security. AntMonitor however, takes a privacy-oriented approach by enabling real-time analysis of application traffic, providing thorough visibility into how user data is transmitted over a network.

These existing tools have constructively contributed to the advancement of mobile traffic analysis. However, each of them also presents limitations in terms of integration, flexibility, and real-time threat intelligence and detection. The following sections provide an overview in details, highlighting their architectures, capabilities along with their constraints, which consequently became the motivating factors Threat Detector development.


\section{PCAPdroid} 
As one of the most recognized open-source android applications for capturing and analysing network traffic, PCAPdroid operates entirely without root privileges be leveraging android's VpnService API. This results in the redirection of all network packets through a local virtual interface, allowing PCAPdroid to passively sniff and monitor network traffic. Moreover, it can log and export captured network traffic in the form of PCAP/PCAPNG files; consequently, making it compatible with standard packet analysis tools such as Wireshark or tshark.
